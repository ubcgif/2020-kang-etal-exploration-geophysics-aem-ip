abstract = {We propose a methodology to generate a 3D distribution of pseudo-chargeability from airborne time domain electromagnetic data. The processing flow is as follows: (a) Apply 3D inversion to TEM data to restore a background conductivity. This might involve omitting responses that are obviously contaminated with IP signals, such as negative transients in coincident loop surveys. The recovered background conductivity is assumed to be uncontaminated by IP signals. (b) Compute the TEM response from the background conductivity and subtract it from the observations. This yields the dIP data, and reduces the EM coupling. (c) The background conductivity is likely not exactly the earth conductivity, but we assume that the major effects of this inaccuracy will lead to a large scale, smoothly varying perturbation to the dIP data. If this correct, then these can be recognized and removed. (d) The final data are linearly related to a pseudo-chargeability through a sensitivity function that is analogous to that employed in usual DC-IP ground surveys. (e) The dIP data at various time channels can be inverted individually. The pseudo-chargeability models may be useful in themselves or they may be further processed to estimate Cole-Cole, or equivalent, parameters. We demonstrate our procedure on a field data set from Mt. Milligan. In the field example, we identify chargeable targets that show no indication of negative transients in the raw data. From the images we can make inferences about the relative strength and geometries of the chargeable bodies.},

abstract = {1 Methods for remote and ground-based sensing of soil water content often rely on determination of bulk dielectric permittivity which may be affected by factors other than water content, such as interfacial polarization (Maxwell-Wagner effect), phase configuration, and electrical conductivity. The complex interactions among these factors were modeled by the Maxwell-Wagner-Bruggeman-Hanai formalism on the basis of self-consistent differential effective medium approximation. The modeling framework considers porous media composed of coated inclusions and enables systematic evaluation of various factors on determination of water content at different measurement frequencies associated with different sensors. Simulation results illustrate the importance of accounting for phase configuration; using a simple saturation-dependent weight function and only two typical phase configurations provided good agreement with a wide range of dielectric measurements spanning different porous media, saturations, and measurement frequencies. The model provides the necessary framework for incorporation of the Maxwell-Wagner effect on standard measurements obtained by time domain reflectometry and through frequency response enables evaluation and a wide array of other sensors. Work is under way to incorporate effects of ambient conditions temperature) and of bound water on bulk dielectric measurements.},

abstract = {A rigorous physical-mathematical model of heteroge- neous conductive media is based on the effective-medium approach.Ageneralization of the classical effective-medium theory ?EMT? consists of twomajor parts: ?1? introduction of effective-conductivity models of heterogeneous, multiphase rock formations with inclusions of arbitrary shape and con- ductivity using the principles of the quasi-linear ?QL? ap- proximation within the framework of the EMT formalism and ?2? development of the generalized effective-medium theory of induced polarization ?GEMTIP?, which takes into account electromagnetic-induction ?EMI? and induced polar- ization ?IP? effects related to the relaxation of polarized charges in rock formations. The new generalized EMT pro- vides a unified mathematical model of heterogeneity, multi- phase structure, and the polarizability of rocks. The geoelec- tric parameters of this model are determined by the intrinsic petrophysical and geometric characteristics of composite media: the mineralization and/or fluid content of rocks and the matrix composition, porosity, anisotropy, and polarizabil- ity of formations. The GEMTIPmodel allows one to find the effective conductivity of amedium with inclusions that have arbitrary shape and electrical properties. One fundamental IP model of an isotropic, multiphase, heterogeneous medium is filled with spherical inclusions. This model, because of its relative simplicity,makes it possible to explain the close rela- tionships between the new GEMTIPconductivity-relaxation model and an empirical Cole-Cole model or classicalWait's model of the IPeffect.},

abstract = {We collected spectral induced polarization spectra with clean sand mixed with metallic particles (either silver, graphite, copper, steel, magnetite, or pyrite particles). The initial pore water conductivity was either 1500 or 1000 mu S cm(-1) depending on the experiments (25 degrees C, NaCl). For each of the 15 experiments, we used a narrow and unimodal grain size distribution for the metallic particles. The resulting polarization spectra display clear polarization peaks in the phase and can be fitted with a Cole-Cole complex conductivity model. In addition to this, the chargeability scales with the volume content of the metallic particles in a way that is consistent with the theory of disseminated metallic particles in a weakly polarizable background. Similarly, the phase scales with the content of the metallic particles in a predictableway. The ColeCole relaxation time shows a rough dependence with the mean particle size. The trend between these two parameters can be used to determine an apparent diffusion coefficient for the charge carriers responsible for the polarization. Finally, we conducted a laboratory sandbox experiment in which we put a copper plate in tap water-saturated sand. We use an approach based on self-potential tomography and compactness to invert the secondary source current density from the secondary voltages associated with timedomain induced polarization. With this approach, we localized the copper plate and determined a value for the relaxation time that is consistent with the laboratory core sample experiments.},

abstract = {A model combining low-frequency complex conductivity and high-frequency permittivity is developed in the frequency range from 1 mHz to 1 GHz. The low-frequency conductivity depends on pore water and surface conductivities. Surface conductivity is controlled by the electrical diffuse layer, the outer component of the electrical double layer coating the surface of the minerals. The frequency dependence of the effective quadrature conductivity shows three domains. Below a critical frequency fp , which depends on the dynamic pore throat size $\Lambda$, the quadrature conductivity is frequency dependent. Between fp and a second critical frequency fd , the quadrature conductivity is generally well described by a plateau when clay minerals are present in the material. Clay-free porous materials with a narrow grain size distribution are described by a Cole-Cole model. The characteristic frequency fd controls the transition between double layer polarization and the effect of the high-frequency permittivity of the material. The Maxwell-Wagner polarization is found to be relatively negligible. For a broad range of frequencies below 1 MHz, the effective permittivity exhibits a strong dependence with the cation exchange capacity and the specific surface area. At high frequency, above the critical frequency fd , the effective permittivity reaches a high-frequency asymptotic limit that is controlled by the two Archie's exponents m and n like the low-frequency electrical conductivity. The unified model is compared with various data sets from the literature and is able to explain fairly well a broad number of observations with a very small number of textural and electrochemical parameters. It could be therefore used to interpret induced polarization, induction-based electromagnetic methods, and ground penetrating radar data to characterize the vadose zone.},

abstract = {A formulation is presented for the mutual impedance of a four-electrode array on the surface of a homogeneous half-space model of the earth characterized by a complex resistivity. The frequency is sufficiently low that displacement currents in the air are negligible. Using such a representation, the mutual impedance or apparent complex resistivity is computed from convergent series expansions over the frequency range from 0.1 to 1000 Hz. We also show the corresponding pure electromagnetic coupling, calculated for the same geometry but under the assumption that the earth is non-polarizable (i.e., the resistivity is real and frequency-independent). Finally we demonstrate that the actual or measured complex resistivity can be corrected for the electromagnetic coupling by a simple subtractive process provided the frequency is sufficiently low. But in general the electrochemical effects, causing the resistivity to be complex and frequency-dependent, are inextricably intertwined with the electromagnetic effects. Thus we conclude that any sweeping claims to correct induced polarization in the field, by various electromagnetic coupling "removal" schemes, should be viewed with concern. ?? 1986.},

abstract = {S U M M A R Y Induced polarization is a geophysical method looking to image and interpret low-frequency polarization mechanisms occurring in porous media. Below 10 kHz, the quadrature conductiv-ity of metal-free sandy and clayey materials exhibits a distribution of relaxation times, which can be related to the pore size distribution of these porous materials. When the polarization spectra are fitted with a Cole–Cole model, we first observe that the main relaxation time is controlled by the main pore size of the material and that the Cole–Cole exponent c is never much above 0.5, a value corresponding to a Warburg function. The complex conductivity is then obtained through a convolution product between the pore size distribution and such Warburg function. We also provide a way to recover the pore size distribution by performing a deconvolution of measured spectra using the Warburg function. A new dataset of mercury porosimetry and induced polarization data of six siliciclastic materials supports the hypothesis that the Cole–Cole relaxation time is strongly controlled by the pore size, and especially the characteristic pore size corresponding to the peak of the pore size distribution from mercury porosimetry. The distribution of the pore throat sizes of these materials seems fairly well recovered using the Warburg decomposition of the spectral induced polarization spectra but additional data will be needed to confirm this finding.},

The data are compared on the basis of fitting model parameters: the chargeability, the time constant and the exponent. The difference between the above two equations (the Cole–Cole equation proposed by the Cole brothers and Pelton's equation) is manifested in one of the fitting parameters, the time constant. The Cole–Cole time constant is an inverse of the peak angular frequency of the imaginary conductivity, while Pelton's time constant depends on the chargeability and exponent values. The difference between the time constant values corresponding to the above two equations grows with the increase of the chargeability value, and with the decrease of the Cole–Cole exponent value. This issue must be taken into considerationwhen comparing the experimental data sets for high polarizability media presented in terms of the Cole–Cole parameters.},

abstract = {Induced polarization (IP) imaging is a promising tool in engineering and environmental studies. Application of this technique for near-surface investigations has previously been limited by incomplete understanding of the physicochemical controls on the IP response, together with a lack of appropriate methods for data inversion. As laboratory studies have shown, description of IP in terms of complex electrical conductivity enables access to various structural characteristics pertinent to practical issues such as subsurface lithology definition, hydraulic permeability estimation, or hydrocarbon contaminant mapping. In particular, analysis in terms of real and imaginary conductivity components offers improved lithological characterization, since surface polarization effects are separated from electrolytic and surface conduction effects. An Occam-type IP inversion algorithm based on complex algebra is described which accounts for these advances in IP interpretation by directly solving for complex conductivity. Results from crosshole applications at two case study sites demonstrate the suitability of the IP imaging approach for subsurface characterization. In the first case study, the imaging results correlate with the observed complex sequence of Quaternary sediments at a waste disposal site. Characterization of the polarizability of these sediments offers significant value in lithological differentiation. In the second case study, the results of IP imaging at a hydrocarbon-contaminated site illustrate the potential of the method in environmental studies. The hydrocarbon location is clearly evident from the IP image, and a markedly different response is observed at an uncontaminated region of the site. By adopting empirical structural–electrical relationships, images of textural and hydraulic properties are estimated as a step toward improved quantitative characterization. The success of the method for these contrasting applications supports further investigation into understanding the physical and chemical processes that control observed IP.},

abstract = {Over the last 15 years significant advancements in induced polarization (IP) research have taken place, particularly with respect to spectral IP (SIP), concerning the understanding of the mechanisms of the IP phenomenon, the conduction of accurate and broadband laboratory measurements, the modelling and inversion of IP data for imaging purposes and the increasing application of the method in near-surface investigations. We summarize here the current state of the science of the SIP method for near-surface applications and describe which aspects still represent open issues and should be the focus of future research efforts. Significant progress has been made over the last decade in the understanding of the microscopic mechanisms of IP; however, integrated mechanistic models involving different possible polarization processes at the grain/pore scale are still lacking. A prerequisite for the advances in the mechanistic understanding of IP was the development of improved laboratory instrumentation, which has led to a continuously growing data base of SIP measurements on various soil and rock samples. We summarize the experience of numerous experimental studies by formulating key recommendations for reliable SIP laboratory measurements. To make use of the established theoretical and empirical relation- ships between SIP characteristics and target petrophysical properties at the field scale, sophisticated forward modelling and inversion algorithms are needed. Considerable progress has also been made in this field, in particular with the development of complex resistivity algorithms allowing the modelling and inversion of IP data in the frequency domain. The ultimate goal for the future are algorithms and codes for the integral inversion of 3D, time-lapse and multi-frequency IP data, which defines a 5D inversion problem involving the dimensions space (for imaging), time (for monitoring) and frequency (for spectroscopy). We also offer guidelines for reliable and accurate measurements of IP spectra, which are essential for improved understanding of IP mechanisms and their links to physical, chemical and biological properties of interest. We believe that the SIP method offers potential for subsurface structure and process characterization, in particular in hydrogeophysical and biogeophysical studies.},

abstract = {The magnetic induced polarization (MIP) method is an exploration technique used to obtain information relating to the induced polarization characteristics of the subsurface through measurements of the primary magnetic field associated with steady-state current flow in the earth. According to Seigel, the secondary magnetic field due to polarization current can be expressed as a sum of the products of chargeability and the derivative of primary magnetic field, due to ohmic current, with respect to the logarithmic conductivity (or sensitivity). The magnetic field and the sensitivity matrix can be computed by subsequently solving Poisson's equation and a magnetostatic problem in terms of potentials using a finite-volume algorithm. The MIP response is a function of chargeability difference (?-?0) and relative conductivity (s/s0), where h0 and s0 are constants. When solving the inverse problem we need to impose positivity of the solution but the fact that MIP responses depend only upon the difference in chargeability means we have options regarding how we set up the inversion. We can: (1) invert for ? without constraints and add a constant to the final result, (2) invert for ? while imposing positivity, or (3) work with ln ?. We compare all three methods here. Our inversion problem is formulated as an optimization problem where the objective function of the model is minimized subject to the constraints that the model adequately reproduces the data. We use a Gauss-Newton method to obtain the model perturbation at each iteration. The system of equations is solved using a conjugate gradient least squares method. In order to make the inversion produce depth or distance information, a depth weighting or sensitivity-based weighting is required. Through synthetic model studies, we have shown that the conductivity ratio between a target and its host has a large effect on the MIP response. Ratios greater than two orders of magnitude difference will eventually make the MIP response undetectable. However, if the ratio is in the range of 0.1 to 10, the effect on the recovered chargeability is limited. The inversion algorithm is demonstrated by inverting the data set from Binduli, Australia.},

abstract = {We inverted airborne time-domain electromagnetic (ATEM) data over a porphyry deposit in central British Columbia, Canada and recovered the 3D electrical conductivity structure. Full 3D inversion was required because of the circular geometry of the deposit. Typical analysis, which assumes a homogeneous or layered earth, produces conductive artifacts that are contrary to geologic expectations. A synthetic example showed that those misleading artifacts arise by assuming a 1D layered earth and that a 3D inversion can successfully solve the problem. Because of the computational challenges of solving the 3D inversion with many transmitters of airborne survey, we introduced a work flow that uses a multimesh strategy to handle the field data. In our inversion, a coarse mesh and a small number of soundings are first used to rapidly reconstruct a large-scale distribution of conductivity. The mesh is then refined and more soundings are incorporated to better resolve small-scale features. This strategy significantly speeds up the 3D inversion. The progressive refinement of the mesh also helps find the resolution limit of the data and an appropriate mesh for inversion, thus overcomputing on an unnecessarily fine mesh can be avoided. The final conductivity structure has features that emulate the expected geologic structure for a porphyry system and this substantiates the need and capability for working in 3D. However, the necessity for using 3D can depend upon the EM system used. A previous 1D interpretation of frequency-domain EM data at Mt. Milligan indicated a resistive stock. We reconciled this result with the present by computing the footprints of the frequency and time-domain surveys. The distribution of currents for the frequency-domain system was smaller than the length scale of the geologic target while the opposite was true for the time-domain data.},

abstract = {Airborne electromagnetic (AEM) methods are highly efficient tools for assessing the Earth's conductivity structures in a large area at low cost. However, the configuration of AEM measurements, which typically have widely distributed transmitter-receiver pairs, makes the rigorous modelling and interpretation extremely time-consuming in 3-D. Excessive overcomputing can occur when working on a large mesh covering the entire survey area and inverting all soundings in the data set. We propose two improvements. The first is to use a locally optimized mesh for each AEM sounding for the forward modelling and calculation of sensitivity. This dedicated local mesh is small with fine cells near the sounding location and coarse cells far away in accordance with EM diffusion and the geometric decay of the signals. Once the forward problem is solved on the local meshes, the sensitivity for the inversion on the global mesh is available through quick interpolation. Using local meshes for AEM forward modelling avoids unnecessary computing on fine cells on a global mesh that are far away from the sounding location. Since local meshes are highly independent, the forward modelling can be efficiently parallelized over an array of processors. The second improvement is random and dynamic down-sampling of the soundings. Each inversion iteration only uses a random subset of the soundings, and the subset is reselected for every iteration. The number of soundings in the random subset, determined by an adaptive algorithm, is tied to the degree of model regularization. This minimizes the overcomputing caused by working with redundant soundings. Our methods are compared against conventional methods and tested with a synthetic example. We also invert a field data set that was previously considered to be too large to be practically inverted in 3-D. These examples show that our methodology can dramatically reduce the processing time of 3-D inversion to a practical level without losing resolution. Any existing modelling technique can be included into our framework of mesh decoupling and adaptive sampling to accelerate large-scale 3-D EM inversions.},

@article{Kozhevnikov2012,
abstract = {Many TEM data from Yakutia and other areas of widespread permafrost bear a manifestation of the induced polarization (IP) effect. The distinguishing feature of this effect is the distortion in the monotony, sign reversals included TEM voltage responses in the time range from a few tens to a few hundreds of microseconds. According to the inversion of TEM responses in terms of the Cole–Cole conductivity model, the IP effects are produced by fast decaying polarization in the upper 100m of frozen ground. Shallow frozen rocks exhibit the chargeability m in the range 0.2 to 0.85, mostly within 0.2–0.5, the relaxation time $\tau$ from 35 to 250$\mu$s (50 to 100$\mu$s on average). As for the exponent c, it is usually in the range 0.8 to 1, which is evidence of a narrow range of the relaxation times. Conversion of chargeability into low-frequency dielectric permittivity gives values of the order of tens or a few hundreds of thousands. These very high permittivities cannot be explained by dielectric relaxation of ice inclusions and/or interfacial polarization. A more likely reason is electrochemical polarization of the films of unfrozen water on the mineral grain and ice inclusion surfaces. It is convenient to interpret the electrochemical polarization effects in terms of frequency-dependent surface conductivity controlled by the surface-to-volume ratio. For an unfrozen wet rock the surface conductivity is small compared to the bulk conductivity of the pore water. However, upon freezing the pore water, the surface conductivity becomes dominant which results in the manifestation of IP phenomena. An additional reason why freezing of a wet porous rock is favorable for the manifestation of IP effects in TEM data is that the relative contribution of eddy currents becomes less than that of polarization ones.},

@article{hyman2002,
abstract = {This paper reviews and extends the theory and application of mimetic finite difference methods for the solution of diffusion problems in strongly heterogeneous anisotropic materials. These difference operators satisfy the fundamental identities, conservation laws and theorems of vector and tensor calculus on nonorthogonal, nonsmooth, structured and unstructured computational grids. We provide explicit approximations for equations in two dimensions with discontinuous anisotropic diffusion tensors. We mention the similarities and differences between the new methods and mixed finite element or hybrid mixed finite element methods.},

@article{fitterman1987,
abstract = {A general procedure for computing the effect of non-zero turn-off time on the transient electromagnetic response is presented which can be applied to forward and inverse calculation methods for any transmitter-receiver configuration. We consider in detail the case of a large transmitter loop which has a receiver coil located at the center of the loop (central induction or in-loop array). For a linear turn-off ramp of width t0, the voltage response is shown to be the voltage due to an ideal step turn-off averaged over windows of width t0. Thus the effect is similar to that obtained by using averaging windows in the receiver. In general when time zero is taken to be the end of the ramp, the apparent resistivity increases for a homogeneous half-space over a limited time range. For time zero taken to be the start of the ramp the apparent resistivity is affected in the opposite direction. The effect of the ramp increases with increasing t0and first-layer resistivity, is largest during the intermediate stage, and decreases with increasing time. It is shown that for a ramp turn-off, there is no effect in the early and late stages. For two-layered models with a resistive first layer ($\rho$1{\textgreater}$\rho$2), the apparent resistivity is increased in the intermediate stage. When the first layer is more conductive than the second layer ($\rho$1{\textless}$\rho$2) and the layer thickness is comparable or greater than the loop radius, similar results are obtained; however, when the layer is thin compared to the loop radius the apparent resistivity is initially decreased and then increases as time increases. Examples are presented which illustrate the strong influence of the geoelectrical section on the turn-off effect. Neglecting the turn-off ramp will affect data interpretation as shown by field examples; the influence is the greatest on near-surface layer parameters. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

@article{leroy2009,
abstract = {Water-saturated clay-rich media exhibit low-frequency (1 Hz to 1 MHz) effective conductivity and effective permittivity dispersions that are the consequence of both the polarization of the mineral/water interface coating the surface of the grains and the Maxwell-Wagner polarization. These low-frequency properties are modeled by combining (1) a complexation model of the surface properties of clay minerals (kaolinite, illite, and smectite), (2) a polarization model of the Stern layer (the inner portion of the electrical double layer coating the surface of the minerals), and (3) a macroscopic model comprising the electrochemical polarization of the grains and the contribution of the Maxwell-Wagner effect. The macroscopic model is based on the differential effective medium theory. It includes a convolution product with the grain size distribution. For kaolinite, the diffuse layer occupies a small fraction of the pore space and is considered as part of the surface of the grains. This is due to the low specific surface area of kaolinite. In the case of illite and smectite, the situation is different. Because of the high specific surface areas of these minerals, the diffuse layer occupies a large fraction of the pore space and is considered as part of the pore space and is described using a Donnan equilibrium model. We obtain excellent comparisons between various experimental data reported in the literature and our model. Then, we considered low-porosity (compacted or cemented) clay rocks and shales. Here too, we obtained a good agreement between the data and the predictions of a model based on a volume-averaging approach. We also note that at very low frequencies ({\textless}1 Hz), another polarization mechanism exists that is not reproduced by our model. We believe that this polarization corresponds to a nonlinear membrane polarization contribution.},
